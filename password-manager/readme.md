# Password Manager
My mother has a bunch of password and username,which is quite long and toublesome to memorize.
She did write down those username and password everytime but sometimes she just forgot where she wrote it.

So here comes my password manager app.

# Function
This is a password-manager that doesn't require wifi-connection as the information is save in a local .csv file.
You can click the generate password button to auto generate password(a random string mixed with number,symbol,alphabet)
