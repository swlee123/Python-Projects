## Usage
The code used news API and stock API to retrieve information.
If the stock price increased or decreased by 5% compare to the previous day,it will send a SMS using Twilio into my phone with 3 trending articles about the stocks.
In my code, I chose TESLA stock since I was quite interested and impressed by TESLA's edge-cutting technology.

## Automation
The code was set in pythonanywhere webstite and will run daily on a specific time.
