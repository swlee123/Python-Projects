# Dota 2 In-Game Stats Provider
![Dota 2](C:\python_learning\Python-Learning-Udemy\daily_codes\python_project\Python-Projects\dota2_stats\bg_img.jpg)

## Idea
I came across this idea when I was playing Dota 2 with a bunch of friends (obviously noobs).
We could peek other people's winrate , profile , match-making-rank (MMR) and other info

## Modules
This project mostly implemented python **tkinter module** for making GUI and **requests module** to request data from [OpenDotaAPI](https://docs.opendota.com)

## Progress
Still working on the user interface, more functions will be added frequently, this is a student's project so please forgive me for the rough UI.
